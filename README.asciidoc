= Netty Wisdom Engine

This project provides the HTTP(s) serving capabilities of Wisdom by relying on Netty. It can
replace the default engine using Vertx.


== Replacing Vertx

In the `pom.xml` file from you project, add the following dependency:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.wisdom-framework</groupId>
    <artifactId>wisdom-netty-engine</artifactId>
    <version>0.7-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

Then, in the `src/main/configuration/application.conf` file, use these properties:

----
http.port = -1
https.port = -1
netty.http.port = 9000
netty.https.port = 9001
----

== History

Initially this network stack was used by default. From the 0.7 version, we replace this stack by Vertx. This choice
was made because we wanted a development model a bit more maintainable and high level (Netty being amazing, but
requiring a very high expertise). From the user perspective, there is no differences.
